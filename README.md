**This repository was created initially as Data Science Series - 4th Course on "Exploratory_Data_Analysis"**

#### Why is EDA Important?

- Key part of Data Understanding process in the CRISP-DM
- What questions will be answered and how? This will help understand data better, pattern better, correlation between different variables/features better etc.

- Handling missing values or Missing value treatment
- Handling or removing duplicates
- Outlier treatment
- Data normalization and Scaling (for numeric variables)
- Encoding categorical variables (for dummy variables)
- Bivariate and multivariate analysis
