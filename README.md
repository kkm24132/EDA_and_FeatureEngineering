## Why is EDA important?
- Key part of Data Understanding process in the CRISP-DM methodology
- Value and Impact that it brings in analyzing datasets and helps in solving problems
- Direct insight in terms of Descriptive analysis / Insights narrative
- What questions will be answered and how? This will help understand data better, pattern better, correlation between different variables/features better etc.

## Tools
- Python
- R
- Tableau
- MS PowerBI
- Qlik

and so on..

## Tasks
- Understand data distribution
- [Identify missing values and perform treatment](https://github.com/kkm24132/ExploratoryDataAnalysis/tree/master/01_MissingValueTreatment)
- Handling or removing duplicates
- [Outlier treatment](https://github.com/kkm24132/ExploratoryDataAnalysis/tree/master/02_OutlierTreatment)
- Data normalization and Scaling (for numeric variables)
- Encoding categorical variables (for dummy variables)
- Bivariate and multivariate analysis
- Feature transformation
- Feature creation / adding new features

## Python Libraries
- Matplotlib : 2D plotting library
- Seaborn : Statistical data visualization using matplotlib
- Plotly
- Bokeh : Interactive Web plotting for Python
- PyGraphviz : Python interface to Graphviz
- Altair : Declarative statistical visualization library
- bqplot : Interactive plotting library for Jupyter Notebook
- Dash : Built on top of Flask, React and Plotly, for analytical web applications
- VisPy : High-performance scientific visualization based on OpenGL
- Pandas_Profiling : Great way to profile and summarize the data in Python Pandas dataframe

This is non exhaustive list. Just to give you some key libraries / packages information that we should be familiar with while using.
